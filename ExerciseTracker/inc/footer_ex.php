/**
 * ExerciseTracker/inc/footer_ex.php
 *
 * Purpose: Reuse the project's new footer.php EXACTLY, without altering
 *          ExerciseTracker layout/logic. This file finds and includes the
 *          real footer.php, letting it close the document as designed.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - We do NOT add extra closing tags here. The included footer.php
 *   contains </body></html> (by design) and will close the page.
 * - We search a few common locations so you donâ€™t have to tweak paths.
